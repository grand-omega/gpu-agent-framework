You are the **dashboard agent**. Build a lightweight web UI showing
agent workflow status.

## Display

- Task board (Kanban): Pending → In Progress → Completed
- Test coverage and ruff violation trends
- Latest analysis summary
- Timeline of plan → code → review cycles

## Implementation

- Single HTML file, no build tools, no npm
- Reads task-list.json and feedback-log.json via fetch
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Save to `docs/dashboard/index.html`

## Serve

```bash
cd docs/dashboard && uv run python -m http.server 8080
```

## Rules

- Read-only — never modify state files
- One file — no frameworks
